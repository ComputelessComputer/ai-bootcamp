# AI Bootcamp - AI-Powered Learning Platform

AI Bootcamp is an open-source, AI-powered web-based IDE designed to make learning to code more interactive and accessible. It allows users to write and execute code directly in the browser while receiving AI-driven tutoring. The platform supports both self-hosted deployments for tech influencers and course creators, as well as a managed cloud service for convenience.

## 🚀 Features

- Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.).
- Code execution within the browser.
- Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and linting.
- Version control and collaboration features.
- **Code highlighting** with contextual AI explanations.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Learning

- **Voice-based AI instruction** that guides users through programming concepts.
- **Conversational learning** where AI discusses topics with users before practical tasks.
- AI-driven tutoring sessions based on user proficiency.
- Context-aware explanations and personalized feedback.
- Interactive coding exercises and guided projects.
- AI acting as a **teaching assistant** for hands-on tasks.
- AI-powered debugging and optimization suggestions.

### 💡 Contextual Q&A

- Users can highlight code sections and ask specific questions about them.
- AI-generated responses and explanations.
- **Supercharged learning** that eliminates the need to switch between tutorial videos and coding.
- Option to integrate with external learning communities.

### 🌍 Deployment Options

- Self-hosted: For full control by influencers, educators, and enterprises.
